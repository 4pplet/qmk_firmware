How to enter bootloader (DFU):
* Press the button on the keyboard. The keyboard will then enter bootloader (DFU) mode and it's ready to flash the firmware.

Alternative option if the firmware is already pre-flashed:
* Unplug your keyboard, hold down the Spacebar and B at the same time, plug in your keyboard and wait a second before releasing the keys. Bootmagic lite is enabled by default.
